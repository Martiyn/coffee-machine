<h1>Virtual Coffee machine</h1>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
The coffee machine is modeled to work similarly to an actual coffee machine. It creates an empty coffee object, which then gets modified as per the steps for creating a coffee.
The machine adds milk, coffee grains and water to the coffee. If the coffee is created successfully, the machine registers a null error. I have used console.log
in multiple places to keep full track of the "coffee creation". Once the "coffee" script is ran the machine will display the coffee creation process in full detail
with all the steps taken for creating the coffee.
